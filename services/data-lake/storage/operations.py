# This file will contain the business logic for interacting with the data lake.
# It will include functions for uploading, downloading, and managing files.
# The implementation of these functions will depend on the business logic of the other services.

# Example functions:

# async def upload_raw_health_data(file_content: bytes, user_id: str, record_type: str, timestamp: datetime, file_hash: str, source_device: str) -> str:
#     """Uploads a raw health data file to the data lake."""
#     pass

# async def download_processed_data(object_key: str) -> bytes:
#     """Downloads a processed data file from the data lake."""
#     pass

# async def move_to_quarantine(object_key: str, reason: str):
#     """Moves a file to the quarantine layer of the data lake."""
#     pass
