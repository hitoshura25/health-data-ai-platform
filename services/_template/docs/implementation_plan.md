# Your Service Name - Implementation Plan

**Note**: Copy your service's implementation plan from the project planning directory.

This file should contain:

1. **Service Overview**
   - Purpose and responsibilities
   - Integration points with other services
   - Technical requirements

2. **Architecture Design**
   - Component design
   - Data flow
   - API specifications
   - Database schema (if applicable)

3. **Implementation Steps**
   - Development phases
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment approach

4. **Code Examples**
   - Key algorithms
   - Integration patterns
   - Error handling

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test coverage
   - Integration tests
   - Performance benchmarks

6. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Metrics to track
   - Logging strategy
   - Health checks

## Quick Start

1. Read the original implementation plan in the project root
2. Copy the relevant sections to this file
3. Update with service-specific details as you implement
4. Keep this documentation current with your implementation

## Development Notes

Use this section to track:
- Design decisions made during implementation
- Deviations from the original plan
- Performance optimizations
- Security considerations
- Known limitations or technical debt
