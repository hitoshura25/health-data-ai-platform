  description: |
    Secure health data upload and processing API for the Health Data AI Platform.

    This API accepts health data files in Avro format from Android Health Connect,
    validates them, stores them securely, and triggers processing workflows for
    AI-powered clinical narrative generation.

    ## Supported Health Data Types

    - **Blood Glucose Records**: Glucose measurements with meal context
    - **Heart Rate Records**: Heart rate measurements with temporal samples
    - **Steps Records**: Physical activity step counts over time periods
    - **Sleep Session Records**: Sleep sessions with stage analysis
    - **Active Calories Burned Records**: Energy expenditure measurements
    - **Heart Rate Variability Records**: HRV RMSSD measurements

    ## Security

    All endpoints require JWT authentication via the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
    Rate limiting is enforced to prevent abuse.

    ## File Format Requirements

    - **Format**: Apache Avro (.avro files)
    - **Schema**: Must match Android Health Connect Avro schemas
    - **Size Limit**: 50MB maximum per file
    - **Content**: Health data records with proper metadata structure
